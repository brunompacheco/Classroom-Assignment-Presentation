\section{Conclusion}

The lecture was a brief explanation using a complex modeling approach for the timetabling problem. To solve the UFSC-CTC timetabling problem was quite difficult [TODO: difficult like for the computer? for us?], even with a simpler version of the real problem. Other constraints could be added to make it closer to the real problem, like professors' schedules, group together classes from the same curricula, adding different classes of lectures (practical, seminars). In the end, the main goal of the lecture was to transmit how important the IP is and give a brief showcase of how it is inserted into our daily lives.

[TODO: I felt that this is a conclusion to the lecture, and not to the report]
