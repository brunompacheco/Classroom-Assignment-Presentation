\section{Conclusion}

The lecture was a brief explanation using a complex modeling approach for the timetabling problem. To solve the UFSC-CTC timetabling problem was quite difficult [TODO: difficult like for the computer? for us?], even with a simpler version of the real problem. Other constraints could be added to make it closer to the real problem, like professors' schedules, group together classes from the same curricula, adding different classes of lectures (practical, seminars). In the end, the main goal of the lecture was to transmit how important the IP is and give a brief showcase of how it is inserted into our daily lives.

The present report had the objective to explain briefly the contents of the UCT lecture. For a deeper explanation, the slides of the lecture and the references at the project proposal are strongly recommended.
