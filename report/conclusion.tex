\section{Conclusion}

The lecture presented a brief overview of the UCT problem with a focus on Classroom Assignment problem. Even though it is a broad problem with multiple facets, its most common formulation and variants were mapped. It was also shown its complexity, made tangible through a use case, which was demonstrated to be computationally costly even with several caveats imposed to the formulation.

The main goal of the lecture was to transmit the importance of IP and to briefly showcase how it can improve many processes present in our routines.
