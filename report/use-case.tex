\section{Use Case}

To demonstrate the applications of the presented problem, a real-life use case using data from the technological center from our university was presented. The data used contains information about each room available and the courses' lectures and their sizes.

To avoid diving into exceptions and particularities, some limitations were imposed by the presenters in the scope of the problem. These were
\begin{itemize}
    \item No laboratory room nor any laboratory-requiring courses were included;
    \item All ARQ**** courses were excluded with the rooms used by them;
    \item Limited course-class hierarchy support;
    \item Lectures bigger than the rooms in which they take place were downsized.
\end{itemize}
